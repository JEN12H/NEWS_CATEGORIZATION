And Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government's willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan's speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \\\"I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,\\\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \\\"He's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\\\"  Worries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \\\"time is ripe\\\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve's decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Athletics Kenya (AK) issued the ban after Chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in Embu. \\\"We have banned her from all local and international competitions,\\\" said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat. \\\"We shall communicate this decision to the IAAF and all meet directors all over the world.\\\" The 29-year-old finished second to Paula Radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 London races, and was also edged out in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.  But the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging Radcliffe at this year's London event in April. Global Sports Communications, Chepkemei's management company, said she had wanted to run in the World Cross Country Championships in March. But AK maintained it was making an example of Chepkemei as a warning to other Kenyan athletes. \\\"We are taking this action in order to salvage our pride,\\\" said Kiplagat. \\\"We have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us.\\\" KA has also threatened three-time women's short-course champion Edith Masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true. Masai missed the national trials in early February, but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. She failed to run in the event, citing a leg injury. \",\n          \" The soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world's major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD.  In its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for the world's main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.  Forecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. \\\"There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\\\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD's chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October.  A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. \\\"The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,\\\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report. \\\"The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\\\" China's booming economy and a \\\"spectacular comeback\\\" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. \\\"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,\\\" it added. However, the report warned: \\\"It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\\\" The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone's over-reliance on export-led growth. \",\n          \" Consumer electronics giants Hitachi and Matshushita Electric are joining forces to share and develop technology for flat screen televisions.  The tie-up comes as the world's top producers are having to contend with falling prices and intense competition. The two Japanese companies will collaborate in research & development, production, marketing and licensing. They said the agreement would enable the two companies to expand the plasma display TV market globally.  Plasma display panels are used for large, thin TVs which are replacing old-style televisions. The display market for high-definition televisions is split between models using plasma display panels and others - manufactured by the likes of Sony and Samsung - using liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). The deal will enable Hitachi and Matsushita, which makes Panasonic brand products, to develop new technology and improve their competitiveness. Hitachi recently announced a deal to buy plasma display technology from rival Fujitsu in an effort to strengthen its presence in the market.  Separately, Fujitsu announced on Monday that it is quitting the LCD panel market by transferring its operations in the area to Japanese manufacturer Sharp. Sharp will inherit staff, manufacturing facilities and intellectual property from Fujitsu. The plasma panel market has seen rapid consolidation in recent months as the price of consumer electronic goods and components has fallen. Samsung Electronics and Sony are among other companies working together to reduce costs and speed up new product development. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras. the huge image of delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot. if printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution, the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long.  the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. the website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200,000 visitors every day.  the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.  the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november 2003. that image portrayed bryce canyon national park, in utah, and was made up of 196 separate photographs. the panorama of delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in mr lyons' image. \\\"he did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image,\\\" said jurgen den hartog, one of the tno researchers behind the project. \\\"we were not competing with mr lyons, but it started as a lunchtime bet.\\\"  the dutch team used already available technologies, although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image.  \\\"we had to rewrite almost all the tools,\\\" me den hartog told the bbc news website. \\\"all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image, so we had to develop one ourselves.\\\" the 600 component pictures were taken on july 2004 by a computer-controlled camera with a 400 mm lens. each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. the stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful pcs over three days. following the success of this project, and with promises of help from others, the tno team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another dutch city, with even higher resolution. \",\n          \" the soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world's major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the oecd.  in its latest bi-annual report, the oecd cut its growth predictions for the world's main industrialised regions. us growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the oecd said. however, the paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.  forecasts for japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. but the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the oecd said. overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the oecd, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. \\\"there are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\\\" said jean-philippe cotis, the oecd's chief economist. the price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late october.  a dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the oecd said. \\\"the oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. if the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,\\\" vincent koen, a senior economist with the oecd, told the bbc's world business report. \\\"the recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\\\" china's booming economy and a \\\"spectacular comeback\\\" in japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the oecd said. \\\"supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in north america and start in earnest in europe,\\\" it added. however, the report warned: \\\"it remains to be seen whether continental europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\\\" the oecd highlighted current depressed household expenditure in germany and the eurozone's over-reliance on export-led growth. \",\n          \" consumer electronics giants hitachi and matshushita electric are joining forces to share and develop technology for flat screen televisions.  the tie-up comes as the world's top producers are having to contend with falling prices and intense competition. the two japanese companies will collaborate in research & development, production, marketing and licensing. they said the agreement would enable the two companies to expand the plasma display tv market globally.  plasma display panels are used for large, thin tvs which are replacing old-style televisions. the display market for high-definition televisions is split between models using plasma display panels and others - manufactured by the likes of sony and samsung - using liquid-crystal displays (lcds). the deal will enable hitachi and matsushita, which makes panasonic brand products, to develop new technology and improve their competitiveness. hitachi recently announced a deal to buy plasma display technology from rival fujitsu in an effort to strengthen its presence in the market.  separately, fujitsu announced on monday that it is quitting the lcd panel market by transferring its operations in the area to japanese manufacturer sharp. sharp will inherit staff, manufacturing facilities and intellectual property from fujitsu. the plasma panel market has seen rapid consolidation in recent months as the price of consumer electronic goods and components has fallen. samsung electronics and sony are among other companies working together to reduce costs and speed up new product development. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as football association rules the club totally supports the fa in strong action on all drugs cases fifas disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a sixmonth ban and the sports world governing body has reiterated their stance over mutus failed drugs test maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the english fa have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it said a fifa spokesman chelseas move won backing from drugtesting expert michelle verroken verroken a former director of drugfree sport for uk sport insists the blues were right to sack mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate it was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make it is a very clear stance by chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club it emerged that mutu had failed a drugs test on october 18 and although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine the romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance the football association has yet to act on mutus failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case \",\n          \" the egyptian government is reportedly planning to privatise one of the countrys big public banks  an investment ministry official has told the reuters news agency that the bank of alexandria will be sold sometime in 2005 the move is seen as evidence of a new commitment by the government to reduce the size of public sector the official said the government has not yet decided whether the sale will take the form of a public flotation the most important thing to decide now is the method  whether by selling shares to the public or to a strategic investor from abroad he said  analysts say the publicsector banks have suited the governments monetary credit and exchange policies nevertheless the egyptian government has spoken for years about privatising one of the big four state banks  banque misr national bank of egypt banque du caire and bank of alexandria it had been expected one of the smallest of the four big public banks  bank of alexandria or banque du caire  would be sold first the announcement reinforces the hopes of investors and international financial bodies for a revival of egypts privatisation programme about 190 staterun companies and facilities were sold off from the early 1990s to 1997 the appointment of mahmoud mohieldin a reformminded technocrat to the new post of investment minister in july was taken as a sign that more selloffs were on the way both the imf and world bank have urged egypt to remove obstacles to the development of the private sector which they say has a vital role to play in reducing poverty by expanding the economy \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

five games after arriving at stamford bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach jose mourinho chelseas statement added this applies to both performanceenhancing drugs or socalled recreational drugs they have no place at our club or in sport in coming to a decision on this case chelsea believed the clubs social responsibility to its fans players employees and other

thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms  a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice  the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brickmaking industries  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50000 square meters 538000 square feet within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis  an international real estate company

protecting itself which is hopefully more of the issue he added that wasnt comfortable out there at all what i was feeling i have to wait and see what im dealing with  its a pretty scary feeling out

the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend  britains first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherines dock to vodafones head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about \\u00a32000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes  despite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched orange had its uk launch in 1994 both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 12 billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made

seeks to boost construction  india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100 foreign direct investment in its construction sector  kamal nath commerce and industry minister announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms  a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice  the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brickmaking industries  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50000 square meters 538000 square feet within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis  an international real estate company  told the bbc this was a big positive step  however chittabrata majumdar general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions citu said allowing fdi in the country is compromising indias own self reliance he said no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country  in terms of employment and money generated  or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets \",\n          \"agassi fear for melbourne  andre agassis involvement in the australian open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the kooyong classic with a hip injury  agassi was serving at 56 down in the first set to fellow american andy roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match my hip was cramping and i just could not continue said the 34yearold agassi who has won the australian open four times will have an mri scan to discover the extent of the damage he said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss wimbledon last year  the good news is that it didnt just tear it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself which is hopefully more of the issue he added that wasnt comfortable out there at all what i was feeling i have to wait and see what im dealing with  its a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesnt feel right and is getting worse its very disappointing and ill have to do my best to deal with it time will shortly tell if it the australian open is a possibility or not i was not counting on this being the end of the day for me maybe in a few days ill have a much better sense of what my hopes will be \",\n          \"mobiles rack up 20 years of use  mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend  britains first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherines dock to vodafones head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about \\u00a32000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes  despite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched orange had its uk launch in 1994 both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 12 billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

seeks to boost construction  india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100 foreign direct investment in its construction sector  kamal nath commerce and industry minister announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms  a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice  the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brickmaking industries  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50000 square meters 538000 square feet within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis  an international real estate company  told the bbc this was a big positive step  however chittabrata majumdar general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions citu said allowing fdi in the country is compromising indias own self reliance he said no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country  in terms of employment and money generated  or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets \",\n          \"agassi fear for melbourne  andre agassis involvement in the australian open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the kooyong classic with a hip injury  agassi was serving at 56 down in the first set to fellow american andy roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match my hip was cramping and i just could not continue said the 34yearold agassi who has won the australian open four times will have an mri scan to discover the extent of the damage he said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss wimbledon last year  the good news is that it didnt just tear it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself which is hopefully more of the issue he added that wasnt comfortable out there at all what i was feeling i have to wait and see what im dealing with  its a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesnt feel right and is getting worse its very disappointing and ill have to do my best to deal with it time will shortly tell if it the australian open is a possibility or not i was not counting on this being the end of the day for me maybe in a few days ill have a much better sense of what my hopes will be \",\n          \"mobiles rack up 20 years of use  mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend  britains first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherines dock to vodafones head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about \\u00a32000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes  despite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched orange had its uk launch in 1994 both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 12 billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

seeks to boost construction  india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100 foreign direct investment in its construction sector  kamal nath commerce and industry minister announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms  a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice  the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brickmaking industries  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50000 square meters 538000 square feet within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis  an international real estate company  told the bbc this was a big positive step  however chittabrata majumdar general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions citu said allowing fdi in the country is compromising indias own self reliance he said no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country  in terms of employment and money generated  or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets \",\n          \"agassi fear for melbourne  andre agassis involvement in the australian open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the kooyong classic with a hip injury  agassi was serving at 56 down in the first set to fellow american andy roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match my hip was cramping and i just could not continue said the 34yearold agassi who has won the australian open four times will have an mri scan to discover the extent of the damage he said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss wimbledon last year  the good news is that it didnt just tear it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself which is hopefully more of the issue he added that wasnt comfortable out there at all what i was feeling i have to wait and see what im dealing with  its a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesnt feel right and is getting worse its very disappointing and ill have to do my best to deal with it time will shortly tell if it the australian open is a possibility or not i was not counting on this being the end of the day for me maybe in a few days ill have a much better sense of what my hopes will be \",\n          \"mobiles rack up 20 years of use  mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend  britains first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherines dock to vodafones head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about \\u00a32000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes  despite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched orange had its uk launch in 1994 both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 12 billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

seeks to boost construction  india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100 foreign direct investment in its construction sector  kamal nath commerce and industry minister announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms  a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice  the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brickmaking industries  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50000 square meters 538000 square feet within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis  an international real estate company  told the bbc this was a big positive step  however chittabrata majumdar general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions citu said allowing fdi in the country is compromising indias own self reliance he said no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country  in terms of employment and money generated  or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets \",\n          \"agassi fear for melbourne  andre agassis involvement in the australian open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the kooyong classic with a hip injury  agassi was serving at 56 down in the first set to fellow american andy roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match my hip was cramping and i just could not continue said the 34yearold agassi who has won the australian open four times will have an mri scan to discover the extent of the damage he said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss wimbledon last year  the good news is that it didnt just tear it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself which is hopefully more of the issue he added that wasnt comfortable out there at all what i was feeling i have to wait and see what im dealing with  its a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesnt feel right and is getting worse its very disappointing and ill have to do my best to deal with it time will shortly tell if it the australian open is a possibility or not i was not counting on this being the end of the day for me maybe in a few days ill have a much better sense of what my hopes will be \",\n          \"mobiles rack up 20 years of use  mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend  britains first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherines dock to vodafones head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about \\u00a32000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes  despite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched orange had its uk launch in 1994 both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 12 billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

seeks to boost construction  india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100 foreign direct investment in its construction sector  kamal nath commerce and industry minister announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms  a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice  the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brickmaking industries  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50000 square meters 538000 square feet within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis  an international real estate company  told the bbc this was a big positive step  however chittabrata majumdar general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions citu said allowing fdi in the country is compromising indias own self reliance he said no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country  in terms of employment and money generated  or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets \",\n          \"agassi fear for melbourne  andre agassis involvement in the australian open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the kooyong classic with a hip injury  agassi was serving at 56 down in the first set to fellow american andy roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match my hip was cramping and i just could not continue said the 34yearold agassi who has won the australian open four times will have an mri scan to discover the extent of the damage he said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss wimbledon last year  the good news is that it didnt just tear it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself which is hopefully more of the issue he added that wasnt comfortable out there at all what i was feeling i have to wait and see what im dealing with  its a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesnt feel right and is getting worse its very disappointing and ill have to do my best to deal with it time will shortly tell if it the australian open is a possibility or not i was not counting on this being the end of the day for me maybe in a few days ill have a much better sense of what my hopes will be \",\n          \"mobiles rack up 20 years of use  mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend  britains first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherines dock to vodafones head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about \\u00a32000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes  despite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched orange had its uk launch in 1994 both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 12 billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

seeks to boost construction  india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100 foreign direct investment in its construction sector  kamal nath commerce and industry minister announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms  a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice  the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brickmaking industries  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50000 square meters 538000 square feet within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis  an international real estate company  told the bbc this was a big positive step  however chittabrata majumdar general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions citu said allowing fdi in the country is compromising indias own self reliance he said no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country  in terms of employment and money generated  or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets \",\n          \"agassi fear for melbourne  andre agassis involvement in the australian open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the kooyong classic with a hip injury  agassi was serving at 56 down in the first set to fellow american andy roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match my hip was cramping and i just could not continue said the 34yearold agassi who has won the australian open four times will have an mri scan to discover the extent of the damage he said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss wimbledon last year  the good news is that it didnt just tear it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself which is hopefully more of the issue he added that wasnt comfortable out there at all what i was feeling i have to wait and see what im dealing with  its a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesnt feel right and is getting worse its very disappointing and ill have to do my best to deal with it time will shortly tell if it the australian open is a possibility or not i was not counting on this being the end of the day for me maybe in a few days ill have a much better sense of what my hopes will be \",\n          \"mobiles rack up 20 years of use  mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend  britains first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherines dock to vodafones head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about \\u00a32000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes  despite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched orange had its uk launch in 1994 both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 12 billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

seeks to boost construction  india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100 foreign direct investment in its construction sector  kamal nath commerce and industry minister announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms  a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice  the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brickmaking industries  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50000 square meters 538000 square feet within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis  an international real estate company  told the bbc this was a big positive step  however chittabrata majumdar general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions citu said allowing fdi in the country is compromising indias own self reliance he said no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country  in terms of employment and money generated  or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets \",\n          \"agassi fear for melbourne  andre agassis involvement in the australian open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the kooyong classic with a hip injury  agassi was serving at 56 down in the first set to fellow american andy roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match my hip was cramping and i just could not continue said the 34yearold agassi who has won the australian open four times will have an mri scan to discover the extent of the damage he said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss wimbledon last year  the good news is that it didnt just tear it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself which is hopefully more of the issue he added that wasnt comfortable out there at all what i was feeling i have to wait and see what im dealing with  its a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesnt feel right and is getting worse its very disappointing and ill have to do my best to deal with it time will shortly tell if it the australian open is a possibility or not i was not counting on this being the end of the day for me maybe in a few days ill have a much better sense of what my hopes will be \",\n          \"mobiles rack up 20 years of use  mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend  britains first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherines dock to vodafones head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about \\u00a32000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes  despite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched orange had its uk launch in 1994 both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 12 billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":
